## 🚀 What is TilePad?

**TilePad** is a macropad software inspired by devices like the [Elgato Stream Deck](https://www.elgato.com/us/en/s/welcome-to-stream-deck) but using Android touchscreen mobile devices instead of requiring dedicated hardware. 

Written with [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) & [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) on the frontend using [Tauri v2](https://tauri.app/) and [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) on the backend

## 🧩 Plugin System
